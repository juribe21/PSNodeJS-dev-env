Getting Started with Amazon API
Gateway
With Amazon API Gateway, you can provide your clients with a consistent and scalable programming
interface to access three types of endpoints in the backend: invoking AWS Lambda functions, calling
other AWS services, and accessing an HTTP website or webpage. To do this, you create an API Gateway
API to integrate each API method with a backend endpoint. Each backend endpoint is associated with an
integration type. For details about the API integration types in API Gateway, see Choose an API Gateway
API Integration Type (p. 126).
To get started using Amazon API Gateway, we present the following hands-on walkthroughs for creating,
deploying, and testing simple APIs integrated with some commonly used backends. The example APIs
used in the walkthroughs demonstrate what is involved to implement each of the supported integration
types.
